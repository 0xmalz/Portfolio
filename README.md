# Porfolio

This portfolio / blog is an attempt to express my professional self and explain the rapidly evolving world of technology in simple terms that everyone can understand.

## Development

### Techstack

This Website was developed using [NextJS 14](https://nextjs.org/), using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as a language and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) as a CSS Framework. I've used [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for components and [Fluid](https://fluid.tw/) to scale utilities smoothly between breakpoints.
